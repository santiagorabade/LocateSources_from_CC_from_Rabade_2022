The location code is made by two parts

1. get_envelope_3D_2share.m : Getting the amplitude out for each station pair and store it
2. plot_envelope_3D_2share.m : Stack and plot the surfaces

geometry.mat file contains lat and lon of stations
timelist0726 contains the time string of the crosscorrelation

The code is thoroughly commented, if not feel free to contact by email.
